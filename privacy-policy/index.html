        device. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can
        modify browser setting to decline cookies if you wish so. In that case,
        some aspects of the service may then not function properly.
      </p>
      <h4>1.3 Information we obtain from third party sources</h4>
      <p>
        When you use any of YG Games Services via your social media account,
        such as Facebook, Wechat or Google (where our games may also be referred
        to as “applications”), you allow YG Games to access certain information
        from your profile on that site. The information we receive from you will

        advertising campaign the install originated from.
      </p>

      </p>
      <h4>5. Methods of Accessing and Controlling your Information</h4>
      <p>You have the following data protection rights:</p>
      <p>
        You may opt-out of receiving promotional communications, such as
        marketing emails we send you, at any time. If you wish to do so, please
        e-mail us at the address provided in the &#8220;Contact Us&#8221;
        section below. You can turn off push notifications by visiting
        the“options”or“settings”page within the relevant game.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can opt-out of interest-based advertising on mobile applications by
        checking the privacy settings of your Android or iOS device and
        selecting &#8220;limit ad tracking&#8221; (Apple iOS) or &#8220;opt-out
        of interest based ads&#8221; (Android). For personalized in-game offers
        opt-out, you can use the options provided in the game settings.
      </p>
      <p>
        If for any reason you are concerned with the way we are using your
        personal information, or would like to correct or request that we delete
        such personal information, please contact YG Games using the information
        in the &#8220;Contact Us&#8221; section below. We will respond to your
        request as promptly as possible.
      </p>
      <p>
        In some cases, we may not be able to delete your personal information
        and will retain and use our information as long as necessary to comply
        with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and/or enforce our
        agreements.
      </p>
      <h4>6. Data Retention</h4>
      <p>
        We retain personal information we collect from you where we have an
        ongoing legitimate business need to do so. For example, to provide you
        with a Service you have requested, or to comply with applicable legal,
        tax or accounting requirements. We will for example periodically
        de-identify unused game accounts and we regularly review and delete
        unnecessary data.
      </p>
      <p>
        When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your
        personal information, we will either delete or de-identify it, or, if
        this is not possible, for example, because your personal information has
        been stored on a backup server, then we will securely store your
        personal information and isolate it from any further processing until
        deletion is possible.
      </p>
      <h4>7. Age Limit</h4>
      <p>
        When we collect personal information, we do not know the age of our
        players. If a player has a social media account and has logged into a
        game, we may obtain the age information from the player through that. If
        we learn that we have collected personal data about a child under age
        13, we will delete that data as promptly as possible.
      </p>
      <h4>8. Privacy Policies of Linked Sites and Advertisers</h4>
      <p>
        Our websites and games may contain advertisements from companies other
        than YG Games that may link to their own websites. We are not
        responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such websites.
        If you have any questions about how these other websites use your
        information, you should review their policies and contact them directly.
      </p>
      <h4>9. Security of Your Information</h4>
      <p>
        We understand the importance of keeping your information safe and
        secure. YG Games has taken steps to assure that all information
        collected will remain secure and in its original form, i.e. free from
        any alteration. As such, access to all personal information is strictly
        controlled. We follow generally accepted standards to protect the
        personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once
        it is received.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition, we will take reasonable steps to assure that third parties
        to whom we transfer any data will provide sufficient protection of
        personal information.
      </p>
